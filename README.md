  -Mission statement
\\Sonic has been a very polarizing character for many years, and my goals with these adjustments are to reduce his polarizing aspects to make his playstyle healthier and more fun for both players and keeping his overall strength the same or slightly weaker while also adding more in the way of references to his source material and viusal clarity to his kit; This also serves to make him more visually appealing and distinct to spectators and players alike.


  -Gravity increased 0.122 > 0.13 (Jumps adjusted)
\\This change was made to make sonic feel faster and get combo'd more efficiently by other members of the cast. I think as a fast character it's more true to the character's persona to have him be a semi fast faller
  
  -Initial dash speed increased 
      1.7 --> 1.75
\\Compensation for speed nerf, retains the idea of sonic having to build up speed, but makes him feel better to play
  
  -Short hop vertical velocity decreased
      1.887 --> 1.825
\\Done to suit his adjusted semi fastfaller playstyle
  
  -Fullhop vertical velocity increased
      3.019 --> 3.219
\\Adjusted for fallspeed changes
  
  -Max run speed decreased
      4.0 --> 2.45
\\Still the fastest character in the game, but with a normal acceleration curve and less egregious at longer ranges
  
  -Weight decreased to 80 from 82
      82 --> 80
\\Basically did this as a compensation nerf for fallspeed changes
  
  -Fsmash IASA removed
\\This move is way too safe on whiff lmao
  
  -Dsmash startup decreased
      10f --> 8f
  
  -Dsmash damage reduced
      15 --> 14

  -Dsmash f8-17 base knockback reduced
      25 --> 20
   
  -Dsmash f8-17 knockback growth increased
      91 --> 96
\\Wanted to bring this move more in line with other moves in its class in terms of utility. Not much of a reason to ever use it outside of a lazy edgeguard option at f10, and there are lower commitment scrapping options that achieve similar results.

  -Initial dash distance and animation speed adjusted slightly 
      40% speed increase f10
      30% speed decrease f1-9
\\Mostly cosmetic change to make his dash dance feel smoother. Dash distance is the same or very negligibly different. Nerfs moonwalk distance.
  
  -Standing Grab animation adjusted to reflect the hitbox properly
\\Explains itself tbh
  
  -Outer standing grab hitbox raised to avoid high profiling in certain situations (tall humanoid characters)
\\Makes grabbing tall slender characters less of a nightmare since sonic grab hits just below the knee a lot of the time
  
  -Bair active frames adjusted
      f13-21 --> f11-19
    

  -Bair f11-13 leg and foot hitbox stats adjusted
      Damage: 16 --> 13
      Base knockback: 40 --> 20
      Knockback growth: 90 --> 100
      
  -Bair IASA window adjusted moved to 36 from 34
      f34 --> f36
\\Made this move 2f faster to make it more viable as a defensive option in neutral while preserving its use as a combo extender/edgeguard but reducing its effectiveness as a kill move 
   
  -Fair landing lag increased 
      f22 --> f24
      
  -Fair foot size and position adjusted to better suit hit/hurtboxes

  -Fair active frames moved to f10-11 and f12-17 from 8-9 and 10-13
      Semispike: f8-9 --> f10-11
      Meteor: f10-13 --> f12-16
\\Wanted to make fair weaker overall in light of the fall speed changes, want it to be used more preemptively than it currently is while preserving its use case
  
  -Terminal velocity increased
      1.9 --> 2.35  
\\Sonic should get combo'd harder than he does as of now since I feel like spring out of hitstun is a big source of frustration among players
  
  -Uthrow animation speed slowed down by 15% after the opponent is launched 
      15% speed decrease f25-43
\\This change was done to reduce actionability and followup opportunities in general, patches out the chaingrab on spacies if they DI out
  
  -Dtilt trajectory adjusted
      100°/100°/106° --> 106°/106°/112°
  
  -Dtilt knockback growth adjusted
      119 --> 124
\\Stops Dtilt uair from working on good DI at super high percents  
   
  -Dtilt startup increased
      f6 --> f8
  
  -Dtilt IASA reduced
      f29 --> f27
  
  -Dtilt active frames reduced
      5f --> 4f
\\Creates more clearly defined use cases between up tilt and down tilt (longer horizontal range and safer on whiff at the cost of being slower on startup and more susceptible to CC vs faster startup, more knockback, and more vertical range at the cost of less horizontal range and more lag) 
  
  -Dash attack startup increased
      2f --> 4f
\\Delet gatling
  
  -Ftilt hitbox placement adjusted to better match animation
\\It covers his foot now
  
  -Dash attack f4-7 base knockback decreased
      70 --> 60 
\\Doesn't break asdi down at super low % anymore
  
  -New graphics and sounds for certain moves for visibility or flavor (Nair, SideB, Down/NeutralB, Dash attack, Jumps, Blast attack)
\\Everything is either a reference to a 2000s or 2010s sonic game or serves to make a move clearer visually while adding flair (sideB especially)
  
  -Back throw start and end sped up by 25%
\\I want this throw to be slightly more viable as a DI mixup 
  
  -Potential new up air 1 (Sweeping kicks)
      Landing lag 20
      Active frames 8-13 and 15-21
      hit1 5% 25wdsk/100kbg/365°
      hit2 f15-19 13% 40bkb/100kbg/80°
      Hit2 f15-19 (sour spot) f20-22 11% 30bkb/100kbg/70°
\\I basically made this because I thought it looked cool, doesn't really work without an autolink, worse than vanilla in basically every way other than looking cool
  
  -Potential new up air 2 (Sonic wind gfx)
\\All stats identical to vanilla except for the second hit is 45/100/70° instead of 25/100/90°, feels more fun for combos imo and makes opponent's DI matter more
  
  -SideB slidekick active frames adjusted
      f6-25 --> f8-20

  -SideB slidekick base knockback reduced
      65 --> 60
      
  -SideB slidekick f8-12 angle increased
      40° --> 45°

  -SideB slidekick can now only be performed after the jump cancel window on sideB has been passed

  -SideB slidekick animation ending frame changed on frame 43 instead of 53
      f53 --> f43
\\Wanted to give this move less endlag while also decreasing knockback and increasing startup drastically. Basically a tool used for tech chasing and maybe read-based edgeguards instead of basically dash attack at ledge but stronger.
  
  -Jab3 angle increased
      30° --> 50°

  -Jab3 IASA reduced
      f31 --> f28
\\Wanted this move to stop being literally useless

  -Disabled subaction 1E since it causes issues with clipping onto plats during blast attack forcing you into lag on hit
\\Explains itself, hopefully fixable with the ECB rewrite
  
  -SideB adjustments (Experimental)
      Initial and followup hit angle adjusted: 361°/25° --> 360°/20°
      Initial hit active frames 2f --> 1f
      Gap between hitboxes adjusted: 1f --> 4f
      Followup hitbox active frames per hit reduced 4f: --> 1f
\\Wanted the hits to link more effectively while also making it easier for the victim to escape via SDI/1-3f options while also making it weaker on CC/ASDI down. 361° --> 360° makes it so this move never knocks down.```
